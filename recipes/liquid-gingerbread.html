    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Make the marshmallowy topping (meringue):</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a pot of water to a simmer and reduce the hear to low heat.
        Combine the egg whites and sugar in a medium bowl (large enough to cover
        the top of the pot). Place the bowl on top of the simmering pot of water
        (making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn’t touch the water) and
        constantly stir until the mixture reaches 175°F or until the sugar is
        fully dissolved in the egg whites and cloudy-looking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the bowl from the pot and immediately whip the mixture using an
        electric mixer on high speed until it becomes white and fluffy. Set
        aside.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the liquid gingerbread:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the milk, 1 tablespoon molasses,
        1/8 teaspoon nutmeg (if using), 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 1/2 teaspoons
        ginger, 2 teaspoons vanilla, cloves, brown sugar, and a pinch of salt.
        Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and continue simmering.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully taste the mixture and add more molasses or ginger to
        preference. I like mine really gingery so I add and extra 1/2 teaspoon
        of ground ginger, plus 1/2 tablespoon molasses.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl combine the cornstarch with a 1/4 cup of water or milk.
        Add the mixture to the liquid and vigorously stir to combine until it
        comes to a boil and thickened, for a few minutes. You can add more
        cornstarch if you prefer the drink a little thicker. Don’t worry if the
        color isn’t as dark as the one in the picture, the result may vary
        depending on the molasses you’re using. Some of my tests ended up way
        lighter, similar to chocolate milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain the drink and serve with a dollop of meringue on top — you can
        toast it with a blow torch for extra flavor.
      </li>
    </ol>
